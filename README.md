# Cultivator's Reward

## Description

Cultivator's Reward is a server-side Fabric mod for Minecraft that enhances your vanilla farming experience by rewarding you with extra experience every time you harvest a fully grown crop. Rather than automating any part of the farming process, this mod stays true to the original gameplay—simply providing a bonus for your hard work. By incentivizing manual harvesting, Cultivator's Reward encourages players to invest in their farms while watching their experience bar grow.

## Features

## How It Works

4. The crop is harvested as normal, with no changes to replanting or drop behavior.

## Compatibility
